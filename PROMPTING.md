# Prompting Rules

## Philosophy
The system enforces structure. The user provides creative flavor.

## Prompt Composition Order
1. System rules (non-negotiable)
2. Template description
3. Style lock
4. User prompt

## Template Locking
- Hard Lock: No anatomy or proportion changes allowed
- Soft Lock: Minor stylistic interpretation allowed

## Style-Specific Prompting

Each art style injects its own vocabulary and constraints.

Users are expected to learn how prompting affects results.
